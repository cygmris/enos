To install RabbitMQ (RMQ) on MacOS X (other platforms available on website):
1) Go to https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-standalone-mac.html.
2) Download and unzip tar to somewhere on computer.
Installation complete.

To run RabbitMQ:
3) cd to RMQ directory.
4) Run command (sudo) sbin/rabbitmq-server
	Without a config file, this will default to a non-SSL connection on port 5672.

Enabling SSL:
(Stop all RMQ instances. To easily do this, run sudo sbin/rabbitmqctl stop
5) In RMQ directory, go to etc/rabbitmq.
6) Create file, “rabbitmq.config”
7) Paste the following:

[
  {rabbit, [
     {tcp_listeners, [5672]}, // Have [] to force all connections to use SSL
     {ssl_listeners, [5671]},
     {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,”/path/to/cacert.pem"},
                    {certfile,”/path/to/server/cert.pem"},
                    {keyfile,”/path/to/server/key.pem"},
                    {verify,verify_peer},
                    {fail_if_no_peer_cert,true}]}
   ]}
].

Restart RMQ by going back to RMQ directory, then sudo sbin/rabbitmq-server.

Have fun!
